# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Visual Simulator

---

### Description

A Python-based application that provides an interactive and educational tool for understanding the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. The simulator allows you to visualize the key exchange process, analyze results, and explore different backends, including real quantum hardware.

### üîß Features

* **Interactive Controls:** Easily adjust simulation parameters like the number of qubits, Eve's intercept probability, and channel noise.

* **Multiple Backends:** Run simulations on a **classical mathematical model**, Qiskit's **Aer Simulator**, or a real **IBM Quantum device**.

* **Animated Visualization:** See qubits travel from Alice to Bob in an animated flow, highlighting how Eve's interception affects the process.

* **Post-processing:** Simulate **error correction (EC)** and **privacy amplification (PA)** to see how keys are secured.

* **Detailed Metrics:** Get key insights with metrics such as sifted key length, QBER, and final key length.

* **Comprehensive Logs:** A log panel tracks each step of the protocol for full transparency.
